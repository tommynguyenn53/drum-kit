# Drum Kit Project

This project is a browser-based **Drum Kit** built using **vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. It allows users to simulate playing a drum kit by either clicking buttons on the screen or pressing corresponding keyboard keys. This project provides an interactive and fun way to experiment with sounds while demonstrating foundational web development skills.

## Features

### 1. Click and Keyboard Interaction
- Users can play drum sounds by:
  - Clicking on the drum buttons displayed on the screen.
  - Pressing specific keyboard keys (e.g., `w`, `a`, `s`, `d`, `j`, `k`, `l`).

### 2. Dynamic Sound Playback
- Each key/button is mapped to a unique drum sound:
  - `w`: Kick Bass
  - `a`: Snare Drum
  - `s`: Tom 1
  - `d`: Tom 2
  - `j`: Tom 3
  - `k`: Tom 4
  - `l`: Crash Cymbal
- Sounds are played using the `Audio` class to enhance the auditory feedback.

### 3. Button Animation
- Buttons are visually animated when interacted with to provide visual feedback:
  - A "pressed" class is dynamically added and removed to simulate button pressing.

### 4. Error Handling
- Invalid keyboard inputs are logged in the console with descriptive error messages to ensure the app gracefully handles unintended keys.

### 5. Responsive Design
- The drum kit layout is designed to look good and function well across devices, ensuring a seamless experience for all users.
